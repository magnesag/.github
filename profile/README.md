## Welcome to Magnes

We are a spinoff from ETH Zurich and we are headquartered in Zurich.
We focus on analyzing human movements by using AI algorithms and
wearable sensors that provide biofeedback.
Use cases of our technology range from management of neurological disorders,
fall prevention, AR/VR rehabilitation and digital biomarkers for new drugs.
